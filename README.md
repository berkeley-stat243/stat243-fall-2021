# stat243-fall-2021
This repository holds course materials for the fall 2021 offering of Statistics 243 at UC Berkeley.

If you would like to audit the class, enroll as a UC Berkeley undergraduate, or enroll as a concurrent enrollment student (i.e., for visiting students), or for some other reason are not enrolled, please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/8mDrVJ6XufaTMCPm9) as soon as possible. All those enrolled or wishing to take the class should have filled it out by Friday August 27 at noon.

You can view the [syllabus here](https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2021/blob/master/syllabus.pdf).

The first three weeks involve a lot of moving pieces, in part related to trying to get everyone up to speed with the bash shell and R. Please use [these notes](first_three_weeks.md) to keep on top of what you need to do.

## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the second week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2021/blob/master/howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md for some options on how to do this. 

## Submitting assignments

The file [UNDER CONSTRUCTION][submitting-electronically.txt](./howtos/submitting-electronically.txt) has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We will discuss this in section on Friday September 3.

## Online discussion and questions.

We will use the [course Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2021/stat243/home) for communication (announcements, questions, and discussion). If you're enrolled in the class you should be a member of the group and be able to access it. If you're auditing or not yet enrolled and would like access, make sure to fill out the survey above and I will add you.
